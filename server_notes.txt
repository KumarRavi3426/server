in backend, always use .js after every import
when importing a package always use "", see name from package.json

since we are making a conversation model, that has only 2 members
the getConversation controller won't work for group chats

when we send the request to mongoose in getConversation, 
it will return the first conversation it finds 
even if it has users, other than the sender and receiver

files are uploaded in binary format, using new FormData()



Doubts:--
utils/ upload.js
streaming, pipelining concept in image-controller when getting image chunks
client/utils/common-utils   downloadMedia

in socket index.js

socket when useEffect (empty dependency array) is called, it will run only once, but it works all the time
Messages.jsx _ Line:38



Changes:--
i have changed upload.js file, and removed bucket name



Things to do:_--

mic, emoji
user status
typing status
group chat
